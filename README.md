# ITMO-beamer
This is an **unofficial** ITMO beamer template made by me. Please, feel free to use it and contribute.

Overall, the template has two slide types: Title and Regular. The Title one has an official ITMO background and the Regular one is pure white with ITMO logo in top right corner.

The template works *out-of-the-box* in overleaf, just copy contents of ``itmo-beamer-template`` folder into empty overleaf project.
